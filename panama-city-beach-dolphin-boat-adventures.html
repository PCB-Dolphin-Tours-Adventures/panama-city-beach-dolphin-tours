"text": "Dolphinaria might have you believe that dolphins are not apex predators of the ocean. They can kill sharks and should be treated accordingly. The aggressive nature of dolphins can make them dangerous to humans, other dolphins and even cause self-harm. The majority of dolphins found in the United States are kept in captivity. However, they are not domesticated."

Kerplunking, which is cool and named after its sounds, is another cool behaviour.</p><p>We do need to note that dolphins are wild animals. Although we know all the places they’re likely to be, very rarely the dolphins evade us. When you book your tour with Adventures at Sea, whether you want to be close to the water or relax on the deck of our pontoon boats. <b>Eco-tourism</b>  We’ll do everything possible to make sure you don’t miss this iconic piece of Florida’s natural landscape.
