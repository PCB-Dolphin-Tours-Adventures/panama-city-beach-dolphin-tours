<div> <p>Although it may be possible to view captive dolphins at a Marine Park, it is much more enjoyable to see them when they are free and healthy in their natural habitat. While wild dolphins can be unpredictable and sightings may not occur on every trip, our captains have been on the waters of St. Andrew Bay for years. They are experts in the locations where dolphins might be found. Our captains will ensure that you have a wonderful time. Dolphins can often be seen playing, searching out food, and communicating with one other on most tours.</p><p>Fin Whale. <b>Tropical</b>  The fin whale is the second-largest whale on Earth, surpassing only the blue whale.<br><br><h2>Dolphin sightseeing in Panama City Beach - Shells</h2><ol><li>Thrill</li><li>Contentment</li><li>Rating</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Testimony</li><li>Anchor</li><li>Sand</li><li>Stars</li><li>Map</li></ol> It can measure up to 88 ft in length and can weigh as much as 76.2 tons.
