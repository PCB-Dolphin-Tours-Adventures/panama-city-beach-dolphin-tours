<div><p>Although seawater acts as a disinfectant, it is possible for disease to be transmitted by wild dolphins. These diseases can pose serious threats to dolphins' health and human health. Finally, swimming with dolphins can be considered harassment. You do not want a penalty.</p><p>DO NOT TOUCH THE DOLPHINS. If dolphins desire to have physical contact with humans, they will request it. <b>Deck</b>  When you touch one dolphin, all of them will leave the area. It not only negatively affects dolphin behavior but it also irritates other people in your group, since everyone loses during the swim.</p><p>How to interact with wild dolphins. <b>Shells</b>  Dolphins are able to eat many sea creatures, including fish, crustaceans and squid. However, other foods are not allowed. Don't touch dolphins. Learn the laws. ... Keep an eye out for signs of behavioral problems.</p></div>
