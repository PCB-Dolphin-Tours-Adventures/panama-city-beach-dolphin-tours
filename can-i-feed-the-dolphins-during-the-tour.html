Destin is commonly known as the Florida beach that has the clearest waters. <i>Testimony</i>  Why is this beach so special? It's because the Choctawhatchee Bay is just beyond this beach. It acts as an filtration, taking in darker sediment and leaving clear blue waters atop Destin’s fine Quartz sand.</p><p>It takes approximately twenty minutes to get to the island. This ride offers great chances of seeing dolphins, manatees and sea turtles. The green ferry boat takes us to Shell Key and we often spot seabirds.</p></div>

<div><p>Shell Island is home to a variety of wildlife, including dolphins.</p><p>Provisioned dolphins can be bribed with fish in order to interact with people. They are not socially connected like the single dolphin. Instead, they will only be interested in receiving free food. They are friendly and curious, according to many visitors. Aggression is still a problem.</p><p>These marine mammals communicate messages to each other by using distinctive sounds and body language. They snap their jaws, make squeaks, and then slap their tails on water. Every dolphin has a unique whistle, similar to a human's name.</p><br><br><h2>Can I feed the dolphins during the tour - Tropical</h2><ol><li>Praise</li><li>Tropical</li><li>Conservation</li><li>Coast</li><li>Deck</li><li>Thrill</li><li>Contentment</li><li>Rating</li><li>Exploration</li><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Testimony</li><li>Anchor</li></ol></div>

<div> <p>Panama City Beach, located east of Destin along Hwy 98 marks the end of South Walton's beaches. <b>Praise</b>  These beaches are widely known to be some of the best and most beautiful in the country. Nearly no river runoff is found in the area, and the St. Andrew Bay filters a lot of the sediment out.</p><p>The dolphins of St. Andrew Bay are wild animals, so it is impossible to predict the best time to see them. <b>Contentment</b>  Dolphin behavior is influenced by the season, weather conditions, water temperatures, tide cycles, and availability of prey among many other factors. Generally, there is a good chance of seeing dolphins any time the sun is out and the water is calm and clear. Feeding activities are normally seen on an outgoing tide. Your best bet is to choose a dolphin tour operator like Panama Beach Dolphin Tours that is on the water nearly every day of the year.</p><p>Panama City Beach: Gulf World Marine Park</p><br><br><h2>Can I feed the dolphins during the tour - Sunset</h2><ul><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Testimony</li><li>Anchor</li><li>Sand</li><li>Stars</li><li>Map</li><li>Voyage</li><li>Excitement</li><li>Waves</li><li>Relaxation</li><li>Wonder</li><li>Heritage</li></ul></div>

<div> <p>Although it may be possible to view captive dolphins at a Marine Park, it is much more enjoyable to see them when they are free and healthy in their natural habitat. While wild dolphins can be unpredictable and sightings may not occur on every trip, our captains have been on the waters of St. Andrew Bay for years. They are experts in the locations where dolphins might be found. Our captains will ensure that you have a wonderful time. Dolphins can often be seen playing, searching out food, and communicating with one other on most tours.</p><p>Fin Whale. The fin whale is the second-largest whale on Earth, surpassing only the blue whale. It can measure up to 88 ft in length and can weigh as much as 76.2 tons. This makes the fin whale the largest of the Gulf of Mexico's marine species.</p><p>Comfortable and appropriate clothing is essential for dolphin swimming. For women, we recommend that you wear a full-body swimsuit and for men, shorts.</p> <i>Entertainment</i> </div>
