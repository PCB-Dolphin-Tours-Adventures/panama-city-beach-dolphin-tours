<div> <p>Panama City Beach, located east of Destin along Hwy 98 marks the end of South Walton's beaches.

Generally, there is a good chance of seeing dolphins any time the sun is out and the water is calm and clear. Feeding activities are normally seen on an outgoing tide. Your best bet is to choose a dolphin tour operator like Panama Beach Dolphin Tours that is on the water nearly every day of the year.</p><p>Panama City Beach: Gulf World Marine Park</p></div>

According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission it is against federal law "To feed or harass wild dolphins." Furthermore, dolphins may be injured in subsequent interactions with humans if they are swimming with them.</p><p>Opportunities to swim with dolphins are available in several warm-water locations, including Hawaii. Costs are typical: A simple shallow-water interaction[1] may cost around $80-$145. Prices will vary depending on the resort's location and the dolphins behavior.</p> <i>Shells</i></div>
