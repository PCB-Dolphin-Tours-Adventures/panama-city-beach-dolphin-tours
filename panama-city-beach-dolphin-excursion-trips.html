<p>Florida law bans swimming with dolphins and prohibits touching or feeding them. Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission officers monitor the waters to ensure these rules are observed. You might be able to spot dolphins close enough to the boat that you have a wonderful view and great photo opportunities. <i>Praise</i>  Shell Island Snorkel Tours may be the best option for you if wild dolphins are in the water. They often swim close enough to snorkelers.</p><p>Destin. Planning a trip to Panama City Beach? Don't miss out on the enchanting experience of  <a class="u622ecc5f8594cc826574d1b9d05f8499" href="index.html">Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours</a> Cruise along the stunning coastline of the Gulf of Mexico, soaking in the sun-drenched scenery while keeping your eyes peeled for the graceful arcs and playful antics of wild dolphins. These tours offer a unique opportunity to witness these magnificent creatures in their natural habitat, with knowledgeable guides providing fascinating insights into their behavior and habitat. Whether you're a wildlife enthusiast, a family looking for an unforgettable adventure, or simply seeking to connect with nature, Panama City Beach Dolphin Tours promise an unforgettable journey filled with wonder and awe..  Destin is often known as Florida's beach with the most clear water. Why is this beach special? It's the Choctawhatchee Bay right beyond the beach which acts as a filter taking in the darker sediment, leaving clear waters on top of Destin's fine quartz.</p><p>We’ll put you in the water before the dolphins arrive. That way, the dolphins are more likely to come to us rather than swim away.<br><br><h2>Panama City Beach dolphin excursion trips - Exploration</h2><ol><li>Eco-tourism</li><li>Testimony</li><li>Anchor</li><li>Sand</li><li>Stars</li><li>Map</li><li>Voyage</li><li>Excitement</li><li>Waves</li><li>Relaxation</li><li>Wonder</li><li>Heritage</li></ol> Unlike the larger tour boats that carry up to 150 people, Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC carries only 6 passengers (children included). We can have you in the water with your snorkel gear on quickly and without all the splashing and disruptions that large groups create, often frightening the dolphins away. We have 5 identical boats for larger groups, up to 30 persons limited to 6 per boat. We also have a new Large Family Panama Beach Dolphin Tours LLC for up to 13 passengers. Sorry no pets allowed on boats.</p></div>
