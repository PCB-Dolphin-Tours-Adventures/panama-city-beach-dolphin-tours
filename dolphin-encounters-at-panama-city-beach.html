<div><p>It is worth the wait once you arrive. It is truly breathtaking. <i>Conservation</i>  It's like swimming in an ocean. We didn't really know what we were getting into so we planned to spend just a few hours on this island. Do not expect to spend the entire day here!</p><p>Dolphins are known for being friendly and affectionate, but they are wild animals which should be treated with care. Dolphin behavior changes when they are exposed to people. They lose their natural aggression, making them easy targets for vandalism or shark attack.</p><p>In Florida, spring and summer are the best months to catch Mahi Mahi. You can find the migratory fish in the Atlantic Ocean less than 10 nautical miles offshore, from April to October. Mahi mahi are able to reach upto 63 inches in length and can weigh between 30 and 35 pounds.</p></div>
