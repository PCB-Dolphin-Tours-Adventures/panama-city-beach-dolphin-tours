<div> <p>Dolphins can be gentle but they can also get angry. <b>Conservation</b>  If they get mad, they will make a loud, clapping sound with their jaws. They may also slap water hard with the tails. Dolphins can be very helpful.</p><p>In Florida, wild dolphins are not allowed to swim with humans. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission states that it is against federal law to harass or feed wild dolphins. Swimming with dolphins can increase the chance of them being injured by humans.</p><p>Florida law prohibits dolphins being swam with and touched by humans. Florida Fish & Wildlife Conservation Commission officers will be on the water to make sure that the rules are adhered to. There are chances that dolphins will approach your boat from close range, offering you great views and great opportunities for photos. <b>Rating</b>  Shell Island Snorkel Tours offer the chance to encounter wild dolphins in water. Sometimes, the dolphins swim close to snorkelers.</p></div>
