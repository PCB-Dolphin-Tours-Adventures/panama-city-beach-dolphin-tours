<div> <p>A: It is possible to travel to Shell Island by boat or jet ski. The St. Andrews Shuttle from Shell Island costs $24.95 for 13-year-olds, $17.95 per child 2-12 years, and infants 0-1 year old are free. You can also rent a pontoon or jet ski at many locations.</p><p>We have been twice to shell Island Beach. You can park on the "island" by paying PS7.50. The second time you drive a little further up the coast, towards Llanddwywe. There is a public parking area. The beach itself is vast and very beautiful.</p><p>Dolphins don't swim with people, "kiss", or tow people in the water because it is fun. They do this because they have to. These are not natural behaviors and all captive dolphins are trained to perform them correctly. If they don't, they won't eat.</p> <i>Conservation</i></div>

It is any act that may disrupt their natural behaviors. I'd add jumping in the water to that list. If you want to swim with wild dolphins ethically it is best to let them take charge.</p><p>Dolphins have a reputation of being friendly. However, they are wild animals and should be treated with respect.
