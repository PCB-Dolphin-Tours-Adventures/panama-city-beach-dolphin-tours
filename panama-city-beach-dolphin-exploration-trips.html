<div> <p>Dolphins do not have gills like fish. Dolphins must breathe oxygen from the air, but they also need to remain in the water. The dolphin can stay in the water while taking in oxygen by jumping out of it. To have fun, increase visibility, remove parasites and improve navigation, dolphins leap out of the water.</p><p>A dolphin tour is a great way to see the area. All tour boats depart Adventure at Sea, Lower Grand Lagoon. On the way to Shell Island, they cross the pass between St. Andrew Bay (the Gulf of Mexico) and cruise south. The view is breathtaking and you may spot sea birds or sea turtles. Keep your eyes peeled for dolphins.</p><p>Dolphins usually congregate near-shore along the coastline. <i>Shells</i>  Shell Island in Panama City Beach offers a wonderful spot to find wild dolphin pods. Shell Island, which is 7 miles long, offers incredible beach bliss and is just across the waterway from Saint Andrew's Park.</p></div>
